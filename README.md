# BulletinGroupBlast
The BulletinGroupBlast application provides an interface for organizations to make a bulletin board announcement system coupled with an event calendar. The organization can create groups for different interests. The app will allow users to download the app and create a profile. Each user can have multiple organizations they can join. If they know their organization, then they request permission to receive access to the organization’s bulletin slice. Once the administrator confirms the member, then the user can see all the groups within the organization. They can then:
•	Join a group to receive announcements and bulletins from this group. 
•	Chat within the confinements of the group by creating a topic chat room and discussing the topic.
•	See the overall event calendar for the organization and group to synchronize the events.
•	Create reminders or lists for each event or group.
•	Share links, documents, and photos
The purpose is to provide an effective tool for small organizations, such as home school groups, churches, hobby groups and other nonprofit groups, to be able to centralize their announcements.
