# BulletinGroupBlast
#####Copyright Â© 2015 Ruben Piatnitsky
<p>The BulletinGroupBlast Android app provides an interface that allows organizations to communicate with their members. The systems main purpose is to be a portal for all announcements on multiple levels - from the individual, to the group, and up to the organization level, and to provide an effective tool for small organizations to be able to centralize their communication.</p>

#####How it works
<p>A user downloads the app. Then the user creates an account. Once in the account, the user can then add organizations that host the BGB database. Once the organization is added, it will appear in the organization list. The organization can create groups for different categories of people. Once a group is created by the administrator of the organization, the user may join any group to be able to communicate between those group members through announcements, chat, calendar events, posts. Some of the features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Join a group to receive announcements and bulletins from this group through news lists and notifications.</li> 
  <li>Chat within the confinements of the group by creating a topic chat room and discussing the topic.</li>
  <li>See the overall event calendar for the organization and group to synchronize the events.</li>
  <li>Create reminders or lists for each event or group.</li>
  <li>Share links, documents, and photos</li>
</ul>
