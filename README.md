###How it works
A user downloads the app. Then the user creates an account. Once in the account, the user can then add organizations that host the BGB database. Once the organization is added, it will appear in the organization list. The organization can create groups for different categories of people. Once a group is created by the administrator of the organization, the user may join any group to be able to communicate between those group members through announcements, chat, calendar events, posts. Some of the features are:

* Join a group to receive announcements and bulletins from this group through news lists and notifications.
* Chat within the confinements of the group by creating a topic chat room and discussing the topic.
* See the overall event calendar for the organization and group to synchronize the events.
* Create reminders or lists for each event or group.
* Share links, documents, and photos

#####Working Features
* A datastructure backend that allows storage and interfacing of the different entities
* Users

#####Currently In-Progress
